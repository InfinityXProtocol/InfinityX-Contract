InfinityX Protocol is positioned to lead a revolution in DeFi with the Infinity Autostaking Protocol or IAP, a new financial protocol that makes staking easier and gives $INFX token holders the highest stable returns in crypto.
IAP gives the Infinity token automatic staking and compounding features, and the highest Fixed APY in the market 102,483.58%, a daily ROI (Return On Investment) of 1.917%. InfinityX Protocol is a developer-based company focused on innovation that creates benefits and value for Infinity token holders. Our IAP protocol issued in the Infinity token giving it exceptional benefits for holders of $INFX:


Easy and Safe – We provide autostaking right in your wallet when you purchase $INFX. There is no need to move your tokens to our website. From the minute you buy, you are staked, and set to receive rebase rewards—the easiest auto-staking in DeFi.
A Fixed APY – APYs that fluctuate means you can never tell how many tokens you will receive. Other DeFi protocols pay out a high APY that can fluctuate by 90% daily. IAP pays $INFX holders a fixed interest rate of 1.917% daily or with a compounding 102,483.58% annually, which tops the industry.
Fast Rebase Rewards. Other popular staking protocols pay rebasing rewards every 8 hours, meaning if you want to unstake, you have to time it to get maximum rewards. The Infinity Auto-staking Protocol pays every 30 minutes or 48 times every day, making it the fastest auto-staking protocol in crypto.

The IAP uses a complex set of factors to support its price and the rebase rewards. It also uses game theory and human nature to determine the most likely habits of those who buy the token.


Our development team has coordinated all of these elements so they work seamlessly behind the scenes. The result is a simple and elegant staking and rewards system for $INFX holders. The IAP is as flexible as it is powerful and will be used as the foundation for a range of InfinityX products, services, and projects going forward. Each will transform a different area of crypto.
